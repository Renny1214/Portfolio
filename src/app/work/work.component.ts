The design is quite simple because it was my first time creating a desktop application. Being a web developer I thought to use javascript in this webapp and used Angular 8 and Electron to convert it into .exe file. The electron made it possible to use this application on Mac as well as Linux. Thats the beauty of being a programmer right, We can create any technology we want.",
