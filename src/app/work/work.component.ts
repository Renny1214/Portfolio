        "Someone rightly said 'Necessity is mother of invention', I am a huge music head I listen to music all day, it is such a sweet thing but the absence of a simple music player always bugged me so I created this offline music player that can play music present in my computer, having functionalities like playlist creation and song skips and previous songs. The design is quite simple because it was my first time creating a desktop application. Being a web developer I thought to use javascript in this webapp and used Angular 8 and Electron to convert it into .exe file. The electron made it possible to use this application on Mac as well as Linux. Thats the beauty of being a programmer right, We can create any technology we want.",
